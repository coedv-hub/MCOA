# Multi-Strategy Enhanced COA for Path Planning in Autonomous Navigation

This repository contains the source code and experimental results for the paper titled **"Multi-Strategy Enhanced COA for Path Planning in Autonomous Navigation"**. The paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm called **MCOA** (Multi-Strategy Enhanced Crayfish Optimization Algorithm) for path planning in both 3D UAV and 2D mobile robot scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **UAV_Experiments**: Contains all the code and experimental results for the 3D UAV path planning experiments.
2. **Robot_Experiments**: Contains all the code and experimental results for the 2D mobile robot path planning experiments.

Each folder contains a `main.m` file, which is the entry point for running the experiments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB (version X.X or later)  
  *(Specify the MATLAB version you used for the experiments)*

### Running the Experiments

#### 3D UAV Path Planning
1. Navigate to the `UAV_Experiments` folder.
2. Open MATLAB and run the `main.m` file:
   ```matlab
   run('main.m');
