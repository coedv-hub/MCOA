# üöÄMulti-Strategy Enhanced COA for Path Planning in Autonomous Navigation

Welcome to the repository! This repository showcases the source code and experimental results of **MCOA (Multi-Strategy Enhanced Crayfish Optimization Algorithm)**, designed for autonomous navigation. We have validated its performance in path planning scenarios for 3D UAVs and 2D mobile robots.

## üìÇRepository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **UAV_Experiments**: Contains all the code and experimental results for the 3D UAV path planning experiments.
2. **Robot_Experiments**: Contains all the code and experimental results for the 2D mobile robot path planning experiments.

Each folder contains a `main.m` file, which is the entry point for running the experiments.

## üìä Results Showcase
### ‚úàÔ∏è 3D UAV Path Planning
- **Total Flight Cost**: MCOA achieved a **16.7% reduction** in total flight cost compared to the average of other algorithms.
- **Computational Time**: MCOA was **69.2% faster** than the average computational time of other algorithms.
- **Path Trajectories**: The paths generated by MCOA were smoother and more efficient, with fewer unnecessary detours.
