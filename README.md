# üöÄMulti-Strategy Enhanced COA for Path Planning in Autonomous Navigation

Welcome to the repository! This repository showcases the source code and experimental results of **MCOA (Multi-Strategy Enhanced Crayfish Optimization Algorithm)**, designed for autonomous navigation. We have validated its performance in path planning scenarios for 3D UAVs and 2D mobile robots.

## üìÇRepository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **UAV_Experiments**: Contains all the code and experimental results for the 3D UAV path planning experiments.
2. **Robot_Experiments**: Contains all the code and experimental results for the 2D mobile robot path planning experiments.

Each folder contains a `main.m` file, which is the entry point for running the experiments.

## üìä Benchmark Results on CEC2014
Before applying MCOA to UAV and robot path planning, we conducted extensive benchmark tests on the CEC2014 and CEC2017 datasets to evaluate the algorithm's performance in numerical optimization. Below are the key results:

### Key Metrics
- **Population Diversity(CEC2017)**: MCOA maintained higher population diversity throughout the iterations, which helped in avoiding local optima and exploring global solutions.
