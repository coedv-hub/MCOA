# ðŸš€Multi-Strategy Enhanced COA for Path Planning in Autonomous Navigation

Welcome to the repository! This repository showcases the source code and experimental results of **MCOA (Multi-Strategy Enhanced Crayfish Optimization Algorithm)**, designed for autonomous navigation. We have validated its performance in path planning scenarios for 3D UAVs and 2D mobile robots.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. **UAV_Experiments**: Contains all the code and experimental results for the 3D UAV path planning experiments.
2. **Robot_Experiments**: Contains all the code and experimental results for the 2D mobile robot path planning experiments.

Each folder contains a `main.m` file, which is the entry point for running the experiments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB
### Running the Experiments

#### 3D UAV Path Planning
1. Navigate to the `UAV_Experiments` folder.
2. Open MATLAB and run the `main.m` file:
3. The results will be displayed in the MATLAB command window and saved in the `UAV_Experiments/Results` folder.
